# BLT Recipient Classifier
Artificial Intelligence Course Assignment: BLT Recipient Classification Using Fuzzy Logic.

## Description
Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1 inclusive. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.

This repository is my work project as student of Artificial Intelligence course. The main problem is to build a classification system using Fuzzy Logic method to determine class/label of data in file `DataTugas2.csv`.
