# The Minimum Value Problem
Artificial Intelligence Course Assignment: Search The Minimum Value of a Formula Using Simulated Annealing.

## Description
Simulated Annealing is a method for solving unconstrained and bound-constrained optimization problems. The method models the physical process of heating a material and then slowly lowering the temperature to decrease defects, thus minimizing the system energy.

This repository is my work project as teaching assistant for Artificial Intelligence course. The main problem of the project is to search the minimum value of the given formula. The optimum value of the formula is -2,17.. Using simulated annealing algorithm find the minimum value from the problem.
