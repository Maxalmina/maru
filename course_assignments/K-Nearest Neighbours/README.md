# K-Nearest Neighbors
Artificial Intelligence Course Assignment: Classification using k-NN.

## Description
K-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression.

This repository is my work project as student of Artificial Intelligence course. The main problem is to build a classification system using K-Nearest Neighbors method (from scratch) to determine class/label of data testing in file `DataTest_KNN.csv`.
