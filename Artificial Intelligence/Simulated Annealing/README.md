# Simulated Annealing
Artificial Intelligence course assignment

## Description
Simulated Annealing is a method for solving unconstrained and bound-constrained optimization problems. The method models the physical process of heating a material and then slowly lowering the temperature to decrease defects, thus minimizing the system energy.

This repository is my work project as teaching assistant for Artificial Intelligence course. The main problem of the project is to search the minimum value of the given formula.

## Problem
$f(x_1,  x_2) = -( \sin(x_1) \cos(x_2) + \frac{4}{5} exp(1- \sqrt{(x_1^2 + x_2^2)})$

Find the minimimum value of $f(x_1, x_2)$, where $-10 \leq x_1 \leq 10$ and $-10 \leq x_2 \leq 10$
